                    An Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (AME) is a licensed person to ensure
                    that aircraft are airworthy in accordance with local and international aviation standards. Each
                    aircraft is required to be certified for Airworthy before being accepted by the pilot for a
                    take-off. This certification is required to be carried out by an appropriately license AME who has
                    been specifically trained to inspect and evaluate the airworthiness aspect of the aircraft and its
                    system. Thus, an AME is expected to be a dedicated, knowledgeable and skilled professional. In fact,
                    the lives of the passengers and crew onboard an aircraft vests in the hands of an AME.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Skill and professionalism are infused only upon experience and exposure.
                    An AME, therefore, exposes himself/herself to several such aircraft, engines or systems and extends
                    his/her scope of the license to cover various types of aeroplanes. This is the way of increasing his
                    qualification, skills and market demand through which one goes up the ladder of success in this vast
                    field of the Aviation industry.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    There goes a saying ´AME´s are not born, they are made. Hence, a student
                    with an average academic background could as well be crafted into a specialized AME if he has within
                    him, the 3D’s i.e dedication, discipline and dynamism. It is here that he/she is nurtured to
                    graduate as a technical doctor for the AIRCRAFT, its engines, electrical, instruments and Radio
                    systems.

                    AEROSPACE engineering is the primary branch of engineering behind the
                    design, construction and science of aircraft and spacecraft. It is broken into two major and
                    overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautically engineering. The former deals
                    with craft that stay within Earth’s atmosphere, and the later deals with craft that operates outside
                    of Earth’s atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Aerospace engineering deals with the design, construction, and
                    application of the science behind the forces and physical properties of aircraft, rockets, flying
                    craft, and spacecraft. The field also covers their aerodynamic characteristics and behaviors,
                    airfoil, control surfaces, lift, drag, and other properties. Aerospace engineering is not to be
                    confused with the various other fields of engineering that go into designing these complex craft.
                    For example, the design of aircraft avionics, while certainly part of the system as a whole, would
                    rather be considered electrical engineering, or perhaps computer engineering. The landing gear
                    system on an aircraft may fall into the field of mechanical engineering, and so forth. It is
                    typically a large combination of many disciplines that makes up aeronautical engineering.</p>

                    AVIONICS derived from “aviation” and “electronics”. It comprises
                    electronic systems for use on aircraft, artificial satellites and spacecraft, comprising
                    communications, navigation and the display and management of multiple systems. It also includes the
                    hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to meet individual roles; these can be as simple as
                    a search light for a police helicopter or as complicated as the tactical system for an Airborne
                    Early Warning platform.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">The cockpit of an aircraft is a major location for display of avionics
                    equipment, including control, monitoring, communication, navigation, weather, and anti-collision
                    systems. Instrumental, Electrical and Radio/Radar Navigation systems are the achievement target for
                    avionics engineering.
